### DCAE-Orch-Dispatcher

The DCAE Dispatcher is one component of a future capability that allows 
DCAE monitoring services to be deployed on demand in response to other 
OpenECOMP events.

Instructions for building the Dispatcher, configuring it, and integrating 
with the rest of DCAE and OpenECOMP will come in a later release.
